# Telegram Chatbot responder

### What am I?

This Mulesoft implementation is a Telegram chatbot able to reply with what you sent him, like a mime and does not accept messages from its similar (other Telegram's chatbots).

### Warning

This version works with an already working Telegram chatbot with encrypted API key.

This chatbot, named "canalelorenzobot" could be reached out on Telegram via this link: https://t.me/canalelorenzobot

If you would like to use your own bot, feel free to edit the ```secure_config.yaml``` file in order to let your chatbot work.

### How to use me

Once you started the project, the chatbot will start to read received message: everytime it receives new messages, he'll answer with your own text, except if you're a bot.
